# Get process-level power consumption in my grafana dashboard

Now we'll see how to get valuable data in a dashboard. Let's say you want to track the power consumption of a given process or application in a dashboard and eventually set thresholds on it. WHat do you need to get that subset of the power consumption of the host visually ?

You need basically 3 components for that:
- scaphandre running with the [prometheus exporter](../references/exporter-prometheus.md)
- [prometheus](https://prometheus.io)
- [grafana](https://grafana.com)

We'll say that you already have a running prometheus server and an available grafana instance and that you have added prometheus as a datasource in grafana.

How to get metrics per process as you may see [here](https://metrics.hubblo.org) ?

The metric that I need from the prometheus exporter to do that is: `scaph_process_power_consumption_microwatts`. This metric is a wallet for the power consumption of all the running processes on the host at a given time.

This is a prometheus metrics, so you have labels to filter on the processes you are interested in. Currently the available labels are: `instance`, `exe`, `job` and `pid`.

If I want to get metrics for all processes related to [nginx](https://nginx.org/) running on a host with ip 10.0.0.9 I may use that query, in grafana, based on the prometheus datasource:

    scaph_process_power_consumption_microwatts{cmdline=~".*nginx.*", instance="10.0.0.9:8080"} / 1000000

Here we assume that scaphandre/the prometheus exporter is running on port number `8080`.

Those labels are explained in much more detail [here](../references/exporter-prometheus.md#scaph_process_power_consumption_microwatts).
