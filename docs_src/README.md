Welcome on [Scaphandre](https://github.com/hubblo-org/scaphandre) documentation.

Scaphandre is a **monitoring agent**, dedicated to **energy consumption** metrics. Its purpose is to help measuring and thus understanding tech services energy consumption patterns. This is key, in our opinion, to enable the tech industry to shift towards more sustainability. ðŸ’š

If at this point you think "why bother ?", or if you want more details about this project's motivations, please have a look at the [why](why.md) section.

If not and you want to proceed, just directly jump to the [tutorials](tutorials/overview.md) section.

If you need more in-depth, use-case oriented instructions, the [how-to guides](how-to_guides/propagate-metrics-hypervisor-to-vm_qemu-kvm.md) are here for you.

[Explanations](explanations/how-scaph-computes-per-process-power-consumption.md) is about theoretical concepts behind scaphandre and the reasons for the technical choices that have been made so far.

If you are already using, hacking or exploring scaphandre and need precise informations about one of its components, go to the [references](references/exporter-prometheus.md) section. (The code documentation itself is [here](https://docs.rs/scaphandre/)).
