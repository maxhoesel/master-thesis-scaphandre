# Compilation for Windows (experimental)

Scaphandre, on Windows, needs a kernel driver to get the same metrics as it does with powercap on GNU/Linux. This driver is available on [this repository](https://github.com/hubblo-org/windows-rapl-driver/). Please refer to this project to get either pre-compiled binaries (available soon) or to follow the compilation procedure.

Once you have a working driver, you can compile Scaphandre, with the Rust for Windows usual toolkit.

For now, all Scaphandre features are not supported on windows. Simply run `cargo build` on a windows machine with cargo installed to get a binary.

Don't forget to add the `--release` flag to build a binary suited for more than test and debug usecases.
