# Installation (GNu/Linux)

Depending on your kernel version, you could need to modprobe the module intel_rapl or intel_rapl_common before running scaphandre:

    modprobe intel_rapl_common # or intel_rapl for kernels < 5
	
To quickly run scaphandre in your terminal you may use [docker](https://www.docker.com/):

    docker run -v /sys/class/powercap:/sys/class/powercap -v /proc:/proc -ti hubblo/scaphandre stdout -t 15

Or if you downloaded or built a binary, you'd run:

    scaphandre stdout -t 15

Here are some other ways to install scaphandre depending on your context:

- [quickly try the project with docker-compose/docker stack](docker-compose.md)
- [run scaphandre on kubernetes](kubernetes.md)
