# Stdout exporter

## Usage

You can launch the stdout exporter this way (running the default powercap_rapl sensor):

	scaphandre stdout

Default behavior is to measure and show metrics periodically during 10 seconds. You can change that timeout with `-t`.
A value of `-t 0` will display top consumers infinitely and must be interrupted with ctrl-c.

Here is how to display metrics during one minute:

    scaphandre stdout -t 60

You can change as well the step measure duration with `-s`. Here is how to display metrics during one minutes with a 5s step:

    scaphandre stdout -t 60 -s 5

You can change the number of top consumers displayed with `-p`. Here is how to display the first 20 top consumers:

    scaphandre stdout -p 20

You can filter the processes to display with `-r`. A warning will be risen if this option is used with `-p` at the same time.
In such case, `-p` behavior is disabled.

The `-r` expected parameter is a regular expression. Details can be found [here](https://docs.rs/regex/1.4.5/regex/#syntax) and tested [here](https://rustexp.lpil.uk/).

Here is how to display power data for the 'scaphandre' process:

    scaphandre stdout -r 'scaphandre'

Since 1.0.0 the flag `--raw-metrics` displays all metrics available for the host, as a parseable list. This might be useful to list metrics that you would like to fetch afterwards in your monitoring dashboard.

As always exporter's options can be displayed with `-h`:

	Write the metrics to the terminal

    Usage: scaphandre stdout [OPTIONS]

    Options:
      -t, --timeout <TIMEOUT>            Maximum time spent measuring, in seconds. If negative, runs forever [default: 10]
      -s, --step <SECONDS>               Interval between two measurements, in seconds [default: 2]
      -p, --processes <PROCESSES>        Maximum number of processes to display [default: 5]
      -r, --regex-filter <REGEX_FILTER>  Filter processes based on regular expressions (example: 'scaph\\w\\w.e')
          --containers                   Monitor and apply labels for processes running as containers
      -q, --qemu                         Apply labels to metrics of processes looking like a Qemu/KVM virtual machine
          --raw-metrics                  Display metrics with their names
      -h, --help                         Print help
