# Why ?

We are facing the biggest challenge of mankind history: to make our activities sustainable enough to not jeopardize our future.

To match the Paris agreement objective of not going further +2 Celcius degrees on average in 2100, we need to transform our industries.
The tech industry is no exception and we need to make sure that its benefits are not cancelled (or worse) by its negative impact.

Measuring power consumption in tech services infrastructures is not as easy as it seems. We often rely on physical devices to do that and need to build in-house data pipelines to get those metrics useful. Furthermore this doesn't give fine graned data regarding applications/processes power consumption but only the host power consumption.
This is even harder in a virtualization environement or as public cloud customers.
