Scaphandre *[skaf…ëÃÉd Å]* is a metrology agent dedicated to electrical [power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power) consumption metrics. The goal of the project is to permit to any company or individual to **measure** the power consumption of its tech services and get this data in a convenient form, sending it through any monitoring or data analysis toolchain.

**Scaphandre** means *heavy* **diving suit** in [:fr:](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaphandre_%C3%A0_casque). It comes from the idea that tech related services often don't track their power consumption and thus don't expose it to their clients. Most of the time the reason is a presumed bad [ROI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_investment). Scaphandre makes, for tech providers and tech users, easier and cheaper to go under the surface to bring back the desired power consumption metrics, take better sustainability focused decisions, and then show the metrics to their clients to allow them to do the same.

This project was born from a deep sense of duty from tech workers. Please refer to the [why](https://hubblo-org.github.io/scaphandre/why.html) section for know more about its goals.

**Warning**: this is still a very early stage project. Any feedback or contribution will be highly appreciated. Please refer to the [contribution](https://hubblo-org.github.io/scaphandre/contributing.html) section.

## ‚ú® Features

- measuring power consumption on bare metal hosts
- measuring power consumption of qemu/kvm virtual machines from the host
- exposing power consumption metrics of a virtual machine in a way that allows to access those metrics in the VM as if it was a bare metal machine (relies on hypervisor features)
- exposing power consumption metrics as a [prometheus](https://prometheus.io) HTTP exporter
- showing basic power consumption metrics in the terminal

You can see some samples of metrics that scaphandre allows you to gather [here](https://metrics.hubblo.org).

## ‚öñÔ∏è  Footprint

In opposition to its name, scaphandre aims to be as light and clean as possible. One of the main focus areas of the project is to come as close as possible to a 0 overhead, both about resources consumption and power consumption.
